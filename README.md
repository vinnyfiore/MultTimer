# MultTimer
Comapre the speed efficiency of different methods of multiplication. 

In order to show the efficiency of different methods of multiplication, this application takes two (preferably very large) numbers and multiplies them. In most cases, built in Python multiplication should be fastest, followed by the "Ã  la russe" method, and then finally by manually adding the numbers together.
